In 2002, Sam Williams wrote Free as in Freedom, a biography of Richard
M. Stallman. In its epilogue, Williams expressed hope that choosing to
distribute his book under the GNU Free Documentation License would
enable and encourage others to share corrections and their own
perspectives through modifications to his work.

Free as in Freedom (2.0) is Stallman's revision of the original
biography. While preserving Williams's viewpoint, it includes factual
corrections and extensive new commentary by Stallman, as well as new
prefaces by both authors written for the occasion. It is a rare kind
of biography, where the reader has the benefit of both the
biographer's original words and the subject's response.

About the Author:

Richard M. Stallman is an internationally recognized computer
programmer, political activist, and author. In 1983 he founded the

including the most widely used free software license, the GNU General
Public License. The GNU/Linux System (the GNU operating system with
the kernel Linux added) is today used on tens of millions of
computers.

Stallman is the recipient of numerous awards, including the ACM Grace
Hopper Award, a MacArthur Foundation fellowship, the Electronic
Frontier Foundation's Pioneer Award, and the Takeda Award for Social
and Economic Well-Being. A collection of Stallman's essays, Free
